## About

Git-pirates is an interactive git tutorial written by my colleague Andrew
Krueger at [enChoice](http://enchoice.com). 

It was originally published for internal developers only but he kindly agreed
to let me post it on github. It was originally written for Bitbucket and is
slowly being ported over for github.
