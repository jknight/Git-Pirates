# Git Pirates

## About

Git-pirates is an interactive git tutorial written by my colleague Andrew
Krueger at [enChoice](http://enchoice.com). 

It was originally written for internal enChoice developers on Bitbucket but he kindly agreed to let me post it on github,
where it's being slowly ported to github examples.
