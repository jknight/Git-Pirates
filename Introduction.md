# Introduction

To begin we're going to copy this Git repository to our local hard drive from where 
it currently lives as a `remote repository` on <strike>Bitbucket's servers (Bitbucket Cloud)</strike>
Github.

From now on we'll refer to a `remote repository` as any repository located away from our local machine and a `local repository` as our local machine.

## Instructions:
`Clone` (copy) this repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/jknight/git-pirates git-pirates`

Checkout a new branch. We'll call it 'develop': 
`git checkout -b develop`

You should now be on the `develop` branch.
