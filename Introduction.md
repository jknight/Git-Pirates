# Introduction

To begin we're going to copy this Git repository to our local hard drive from where 
it currently lives as a `remote repository` on <strike>Bitbucket's servers (Bitbucket Cloud)</strike>
Github.

From now on we'll refer to a `remote repository` as any repository located away from our local machine and a `local repository` as our local machine.

## Join the League of Pirates

The first thing we need to do is get a local copy of the source code. We'll do this by *cloning* this git repository.
Open a command prompt, cd to a directory where you keep your code, and enter the command:

`git clone https://github.com/jknight/git-pirates git-pirates`

We'll now create a new branch called 'pirates/booty':

`git checkout -b pirates/booty`

This command both creates a new branch and switches us into the branch.
You should now be on the `pirates/booty` branch.
